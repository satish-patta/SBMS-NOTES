============
Spring Boot
============

-> Spring Boot is one approach to develop Spring Based applications with less configurations.

-> Using Spring Boot we can develop below types of applications

			1) Standalone app
			2) Web 
			3) Distributed (webservices)

-> We have below advantages with Spring Boot

1) Starter Pom (simplifies maven/gradle build configuration)

				-> web-starter
				-> datajpa-starter
				-> security-starter
				-> mail-starter

2) Auto Configuration (boot will identify required configs for our app)

				-> Creating db connection pool
				-> deploy web app in embedded server
				-> Start IOC container
				-> Component Scanning


3) Actuators (To monitor and manage our application)

				-> how many beans loaded ?
				-> How many url-patterns mapped
				-> What configuration properties loaded ?
				-> What is health of app?
				-> Heap Dump
				-> Thread Dump


4) Embedded Servers : It provides server to run our boot application

			-> Apache Tomcat (default)
			-> Jetty
			-> netty

=================================
Creating Spring Boot Application
==================================

1) Initializr website (start.spring.io)

2) IDE


Note: IDE will internally connect with start.spring.io website to create SpringBoot application (Spring Starter Project)


Spring Boot = 

Spring  - xml configurations + Auto Config + Embedded Servers + Actuators




=====================================
What is Start Class in Spring Boot ?
=====================================

-> Start class is entry point for boot application execution.

-> Start class is also called as main class in Spring Boot.


Note: When we create boot app, start class will create by default


@SpringBootApplication
public class Application{

	public static void main(String... args){
			
		SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);

	}

}


=> The @SpringBootApplication annotation is equal to below 3 annotations

1) @SpringBootConfiguration ----> @Configuration
2) @EnableAutoConfiguration
3) @ComponentScan


======================================
How IOC starting in Spring Boot ?
======================================

=> SpringApplication.run ( ) method contains logic to start IOC container


boot-starter :: AnnotationConfigApplicationContext
web-starter :: AnnotationConfigServletWebServerApplicationContext
starter-webflux :: AnnotationConfigReactiveWebServerApplicationContext

================================
What is Banner in Spring Boot ?
================================

-> Spring Logo which is printing on console is called as banner

-> We have below 3 modes for banner

			1) console  (default) --->> prints on console
			2) log ---->> prints on log file
			3) off  --->> don't print banner


-> We can set banner mode in application.properties file

		spring.main.banner-mode=off


-> We can customize banner text in spring boot by creating banner.txt file under src/main/resources folder.
